	<h>Intro</h>
<p>As far as the <a href="http://github.com/kung-fu-tzu/ngx_http_js_module/blob/master/src/classes/Request/HeadersIn.c">Nginx.HeadersIn</a> and <a href="http://github.com/kung-fu-tzu/ngx_http_js_module/blob/master/src/classes/Request/HeadersOut.c">Nginx.HeadersOut</a> classes of the <a href="http://github.com/kung-fu-tzu/ngx_http_js_module/">ngx_http_js_module</a> implemented almost fully now we can talk about this <code>headers_in</code> struct a little.</p>

<p>The HTTP headers in nginx are split in two parts: the input request headers (<a href="http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/source/http/ngx_http_request.h#L162"><code>headers_in</code></a> structure) and the output request headers (<a href="http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/source/http/ngx_http_request.h#L227"><code>headers_out</code></a> structure). There is no such an entity as a response, all data is stored in the same single request structure. The actual response data is constructed from the request data and the <code>headers_out</code> structure fields.</p>

<p>All the things in nginx are highly optimized. No memory overhead caused by strings copying, no memory leaks and alloc/free burden as far as memory is managed with pools, no wasted CPU cycles by comparing those strings again and again, everything is cached in a sane way, complicated things are pre-calculated at configure stage. So are the input (and output) headers and all this optimizations are the root of their complexity and beauty.</p>

<section>
<h><a id="http-headers" href="#http-headers">A flexibility of the HTTP headers</a></h>

<p>Lets talk about HTTP headers a little. All of us have seen lots of headers. And we know that the HTTP header is a very flexible data format. Client may send only one simple header, or many headers with the same name each on its own line, or even one big header split into many lines. It's a kinda mess. And nginx in its turn tries to rule the mess.</p>

<p>nginx takes care of known frequently used headers (<a href="http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/source/http/ngx_http_request.c#L80">list of known <code>headers_in</code></a>). It parses it and stores in the handy place (direct pointer in <code>headers_in</code>). If a known header may consist of more then one value (Cookies or Cache-Control for example.) nginx could handle it with an array. And for a header that known to have a numeric value (Content-Length, Expires) nginx will parse the text and store it directly in the <code>headers_in</code> struct. All the rest of headers are carefully stored in a simple list within the <code>headers_in</code> structure, so nothing is been lost.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h><a id="get-the-header" href="#get-the-header">Get the header</a></h>
<p>That said, there are at least three ways to get the value. As we already know, every input header value may be obtained by a brute force lookup in the <a href="http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/source/http/ngx_http_request.h#L163"><code>headers_in->headers</code></a> list (typeof <a href="http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/ident?i=ngx_list_t"><code>ngx_list_t</code></a>). The known header value may be found with a help of a simple pointer in the <code>headers_in</code> structure (<code>NULL</code> if the header does not exists). And for the known numeric headers there is even easier way to get the value: by a special field in the <code>headers_in</code> (<a href="http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/source/http/ngx_http_request.h#L214"><code>content_length_n</code></a> is a good example).</p>

<p>This is good if you know at compile time which header you are going to read. But how do we get the header by its name at run time where the name is just a string? For this kind of situation we have a smart hash of headers ???. If the header is known to nginx the header name is cached within this hash and we can find the header value relatively fast. If the header hasn't been hashed we'll have to run through the full headers list and compare all headers names with our one. This isn't very fast but also isn't slow. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the offset of the digital (already parsed) representation of the header by its name, we have to parse text value every time it's needed. And it's normal while we do not know the data type of the representation of a random header at run time.</p>

<p>So far, we can get a full list of input headers and run through it to enumerate, direct access a header with its personal field in <code>headers_in</code> structure; and we even may get the already parsed value if the header is of type number, time etc.</p>


<p>Some examples follow.</p>

<p>The examples give a good illustration for how much faster the cached and optimized header access may be even compared to the search with a pre-hashed key.</p>

<section>
<h><a id="how-is-made-hashed-seach" href="#how-is-made-hashed-seach">How does hashed search work?</a></h>
<p>At the configuration stage nginx creates a hash (<a href="http://lxr.evanmiller.org/http/ident?i=ngx_hash_t"><code>ngx_hash_t</code></a>) of known HTTP headers (as mentioned above). In each pair the key is a the header name and the value is a nginx header handler structure (pretty smart structure, you know). In this structure we can see the header name, its handler on a stage of headers parsing (for internal use) and, the most interesting, the offset of the header value in the headers_in struct. This offset is used to fill the appropriate field in the request struct when the request value is been adding. At the parsing stage nginx calculates a hash of the lowercased header name (HTTP headers names are case-insensitive) and searches the header handler by this hash (in main conf headers has). If the handler is found nginx invokes it, otherwise just adds the key/value pair to the plain list of headers (<code>headers_in.headers</code>). Pretty simple if you know how it' made ;)</p>

<section>
<h><a id="output-headers" href="#output-headers">What about output headers?</a></h>

<p>If you've red the post you do know almost everything about <code>headers_out</code>. The only difference is the headers_out hasn't a hash to find the output header by its name at runtime.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h><a id="get-a-header" href="#get-a-header">How can I set a header?</a></h>

<p>As far as nginx may store a header value in many places you have to be careful setting a header. Every known header needs a special way to be set. If it is a numeric header you could set it three times: a plain key/value pair in the list, the pointer in headers_in struct and the actual numeric value in the special field of headers_in. Every step reflects the way you get the header value.</p>

<section>
<h><a id="content-length" href="#content-length">For example set the Content-Length in <code>headers_out</code></a></h>
<pre><code class="cpp">
ngx_int_t
set_content_length_n_in_headers_out(ngx_http_request_t *r, ngx_str_t *length, off_t length_n) {
	ngx_table_elt_t   *h;
	
	h = r->headers_out.content_length;
	if (h == NULL) {
		/*
		The header is not present at all. We have to allocate it...
		*/
		h = ngx_list_push(&r->headers_out.headers);
		if (h == NULL) {

		}
		
		/*

		*/
		h->key.data = (u_char *) "Content-Length";
		h->key.len = sizeof("Content-Length") - 1;
		
		/*
		... and then set the headers_out field to tell others
		that the header is already set.
		*/
		r->headers_out.content_length = h;
	}
	
	/*
	So far we have the header and are able to set its value.
	Do not forget to allocate the length.data memory in such

	The best place to store the data is the request pool (r->pool),
	of course.
	*/
	h->value = *length;
	
	/*

	in the actual response. Otherwise the header will be ignored and client
	will never see it. To date the value must be just non zero.

<h>Coming soon</h>
<p>In the next post (whenever it posted) we will look at the real code of header management from the <a href="http://github.com/kung-fu-tzu/ngx_http_js_module/">ngx_http_js_module</a>. It is much more fun to see some working stuff instead of cold examples.</p>
