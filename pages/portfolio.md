### Inshaker

<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsCbq0xJpD0"><img src="inshaker.jpg"></a>

Inshaker is the Russian site about cocktails, bars, bartenders, and all [the cocktail culture](https://www.facebook.com/inshaker) as a whole. Launched in 2009 it is known to use as much of presentational technology as it is sane to.

As a the Lead Front-end Developer I did all kinds of tasks here: pixel perfect markup, vanilla JS coding, implementing widgets, UI design, and more. All the widgets are hand made with love.

I also did all the backend stuff with all them servers, round-robins, caches, etc.


### RetailStars

RetailStars is a head hunting agency dedicated to retail. It covers more than 40 cities all over the Russia. Launched in 2008 with all dynamic interface it was a breakthrough in the job site market. People loved the interface so much that they sent us filled forms just for fun.

As a the Lead Front-end Developer I did, again, all kinds of tasks here: pixel perfect markup, vanilla JS coding, implementing lots of widgets, UI design (with two successful redesigns) and more. All the widgets are built from scratch and are cross-browser starting with MSIE 6.

For an experienced backend developer it was a pleasure for me to make some server-side magic here.
