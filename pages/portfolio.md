### Inshaker

<a href="//www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsCbq0xJpD0"><img src="inshaker.jpg"></a>

Inshaker is the Russian site about cocktails, bars, bartenders, and all [the cocktail culture](https://www.facebook.com/inshaker) as a whole. Launched in 2009 it is known to use as much of presentational technology as it is sane to.

As a the Lead Front-end Developer I did all kinds of tasks here: pixel perfect markup, vanilla JS coding, implementing widgets, UI design, and more. All the widgets are hand made with love.

I also did all the backend stuff with all them servers, round-robins, caches, etc.
