# Hello there!
My name is Peter. I'm 28. Live in Moscow, Russia.

Tag cloud of me: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Photoshop, Ruby, Perl, C, nginx, Linux.

Social: [Github](https://github.com/kung-fu-tzu), [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=209349898)

Let me try to save your time and define who I am and who not.

# What I can do not

First of all I can't flawlessly speak **English**. Expect me stuck looking for a translation in a dictionary and messing up all the perfect continuous present simple stuff (as will be seen below). I can write a little letter (like this resume). Definitely, I can read internets, but reading a novel becomes pleasure mixed with pain. Also, I can understand native English speech at medium speed and complexity.

I do not know **Java**. At all. Yes, the syntax is familiar to me, OOP is a native thing to me, but the whole Java word is foreign.

**Modern C++** with all its **STL**, **Boost**, atomics, compilers, and CPU-related tricks is precisely the thing I hove no idea of.

I do understand **Ruby on Rails** with all its MVC, ActiveRecord, migrations and some more, but never had a chance to build a project up on it. Must say, that the raw Ruby language is my favorite one in many terms except performance ;)

I hate **XSLT**. Period.

Have no knowledge of **Word**, **Excel**, **PowerPoint** and so on with **Windows** included. Mac OS X is the only OS of mine for more than 7 years to date.

**Linux as a kernel** is a mystery for me.



# What I think I can do best

**JavaScript** is the major programming language of mine for the last 7 years. I was dedicated to code client side apps 24/7. First line of JS code had been drop somewhat near 14 years ago. I guess there were more than 10,000 hours of programming JS.

**HTML** from v3 to v5, from `<TR><TD><TABLE><TD BACKGROUND="i/bg_1_14.gif"><FONT COLOR=RED>` to `<li class="goods-list-item">` in 13 years. From MSIE 5 to Chrome. From `&copy;` to `©`. From GIF to 8-bit semi-transparent PNG. From JPEG to… JPEG ;)

**Testing code**. Oh, I really love it! The reliable code, what can be better? The Extreme Programming Explained book inspired me to test as much as a project permits. Working on a complex projects without a comprehensive test suit is a pain for developer and for the project leader. I saw such a mess from both sides.



# What I think I can do well

**Ruby** is the second language of my last projects. First seen it in late 2006 and fell in love instantly. Switching from Perl to Ruby was a great period of time. From time to time Ruby helped me with sending emails, building simple HTTP daemons, proceeding Google Analytics output, converting images, bake web pages, and many more. And Rails are beautiful because of Ruby, of cause. For a month in 2007 I'v tried to write Ruby-to-JavaScript compiler. For the last month now in 2013 I'v participated in Opal project. It's main goal is to bring Ruby to the browser too. These two attempts of writing a Ruby in JavaScript gave me a much deeper view of the two languages.

**Perl** gave me all I have today. It really made hard things possible. Way back in 1999 Perl began to teach me build big things revealing its power step by step, dose by dose. Perl can do anything, and so were me. I woke up and went to sleep with Programming Perl, Perl Cookbook, Perl DBI, and some smaller other books. Perl gave me my first well paid work in 2001. First seen in Hacker Magazine in 1999 and compiled last script in 2009 for me Perl was my best friend indeed. Thank you, Larry!

**C** has been around for ever. When I was 13, the first academic lessons of programming languages I'v ever got were in C. Then, reading books about Linux kernel, networking daemons, and filesystem I saw lots of examples in C. And than C again in the nginx project. The latter forced me to re-learn C again mixed with async event based network programming on the fly. That was vary hard but fun and I can't wait to participate in such a hardcore in future.

**Linux** as an OS is a home, sweet home for me. No way to say I'm a hardcore system administrator, but I can imagine me building a backend on linux only. The fist Linux disto I saw was Red Hat Linux in 2000. My friend and me were trying to install it on a PC with no success except getting the command prompt and listing directories. But those were directories of some alien technology, of Linux :)

**Git** have saved me amount of time in half the size of my life already, and going to save much much more. What does it means “to be good at Git”? IMHO, that means thoughtful branching, clean and frequent atomic commits, good commit annotations, rebase with cleanup before push, bisect, and many more handy things. Everything starts with `git init`.

**Usability** rules everything. Those underestimating UI role pay twice for any step in an application development. For the last 6 years I did review and create UI design. It is really fun to imagine all the rotes users may pass through the UI, predict all the use cases, test, and optimize every UI element to gain a harmony in code, style and action.



# Background

The main two periods of my education/work/projects:

1. 2006-2013

Single company, single big project: [www.inshaker.ru](http://www.inshaker.ru/)

As a team lead, I did here all flavors of JavaScript. Were the administrator of a few linux servers. Had designed (UI only, not graphics) few heavily interactive pages, implemented them and do support them till now.

Also, Ruby helped me to do all kinds of the server side job.

Besides coding, as far as I were a team lead and co-founder I have done lots of management. Hiring programmers, introducing them to the project, support them in the fly, and saying them a sad goodbyes - all the cycle I had pass several times.

As an outcome of this period I may count:

 - liby.js (second big thing in my life): full stack JS library and widget set for browsers from MSIE 6 to the latest Chrome;
 - ngx_http_js_module: an experiment of embedding JS engine into the event based nginx http server;
 - bloggin on technologies: it helped me a lot to understand the experience I were getting.

2. 2000-2006

Perl, Perl, Perl :)

As a perl developer I had an opportunity to work for some small companies as a junior developer, medium developer, a team lead, and work for for myself.

The main project of this period is my beloved CMS Builder (first big thing in my life). It was a framework for development of complex web sites written in modern Perl. It has a lot of cool features (such as ORM) and I'm really proud of it.

Oh, yes. As most of us developers I did try to write a game. A 2D puzzle (quest) game based on some stories of teenagers. As always, the game ended up as an engine. It was based on DirectX (very old DirectDraw API) as a graphics engine and Perl as a script engine. All the mechanic and logic of the game was written in Perl. The two most interesting things are: fast 2D images and animation rendering, and binding the C++ code to the Perl script engine.

# Some lyrics

I really like games Braid, FEZ, and Portal. And Machinarium too.
In Quake-like game Sauerbraten (Cube 2) our office team of geeks gain a lot of frags last years.
