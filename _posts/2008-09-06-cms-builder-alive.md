Still at positions 4th, 5th, and 7th in Google and 2nd in Yandex for search query “cms builder”. And the are real visitiors. It's nice that somebody still remember our old giant, useful it was. Curently we do not use Builder anyhow, but we do not use any CMS currently :)</p>

My heart suggests me that some part of CMS Builder will be of use in future.

**UPD 2010-11-29**: the experience of backend programming valued untill now.

**UPD 2015-05-14**: hooray, the templating engine written as one line of Perl code got used in nginx Docker container!
